                                        <p>People have two sets of teeth in their lives, the primary teeth (also called
                                            the baby, milk or deciduous teeth) and the permanent teeth (also called the
                                            adult or secondary teeth). Children have 20 primary teeth;
                                            they are replaced by the permanent teeth by about age 13. Adults have 32
                                            permanent teeth.</p>

                                        <p>Teeth are used to bite and chew food- they are the first step in the
                                            digestion of food. The long, sharp canine teeth tear up food (like meat).
                                            The wide, flat molars grind and mash up food. While we chew food, the
                                            tongue pushes the food to the teeth and saliva helps digestion and wets the
                                            food. Teeth also help us say certain sounds. The shape of the arch inside
                                            the mouth helps you talk. Many letters of the alphabet cannot
                                            be sounded without the help of teeth.</p>

                                        <p><b><u>Primary Teeth:</u><b> Most babies are born with no teeth showing (the
                                                    teeth are forming inside the gums). The 20 primary teeth (also
                                                    called baby teeth or first teeth) erupt (poke through the gums) over
                                                    the time from when a baby is from about 6 months to a year old.</p>

                                        <p><b><u>Permanent Teeth:</u></b> Primary teeth fall out and are replaced by 32
                                            permanent teeth (also called the adult teeth). This happens over the time
                                            from when a child is from about 6 to 14 years old.</p>

                                        <p>As a permanent tooth forms under the gums and in the jawbone, the roots of
                                            the primary tooth it is replacing dissolve. Then the primary tooth becomes
                                            loose and falls out. The permanent tooth will fill the space.</p>

                                        <p><b><u>Wisdom Teeth:</u></b> Wisdom teeth (also called the third molars) are
                                            molars that usually erupt from the ages of 17 to 21.</p>

                                        <p>Teeth vary in size, shape and their location in the jaws. These differences
                                            enable teeth to work together to help you chew, speak and smile. They also
                                            help give your face its shape and form.</p>

                                        <p>At birth people usually have 20 primary (baby) teeth, which often erupt as
                                            early as six months of age. They are then shed at various times throughout
                                            childhood. By age 21, all 32 of the permanent teeth have usually
                                            erupted.</p>

                                        <p>The human tooth has two primary components: the <b>crown</b> and <b>root</b>.
                                            The crown is the portion of the tooth that projects above the gums while the
                                            root is that portion that anchors the tooth to the bone.</p>

                                        <p>The teeth are composed of 4 tissues. The <b>enamel</b> covers the crown of
                                            the teeth and is the hardest known substance in the human body. This extreme
                                            hardness is necessary to survive the powerful forces exerted
                                            on the tooth surface during chewing.</p>

                                        <p>Inner to the enamel is the <b>dentin</b> forming the bulk of the tooth.
                                            Cementum covers the root portion of the tooth and gives attachment to
                                            certain fibers called periodontal ligament that help the tooth attach
                                            to the jaws.</p>

                                        <p>The <b>Pulp</b> is the innermost part of the tooth containing the nerves,
                                            blood vessels and other cells. The pulp is the vital area of the tooth. Gums
                                            are soft tissues that cover the tooth like a collar.</p>

                                        <p>Teeth have different shapes for different jobs. For example, when you eat,
                                            the upper teeth work together with the lower teeth of the same shape to
                                            bite, chew, and tear food. The names of these teeth are</p>

                                        <ul>

                                            <li><b>Incisors (Central & Lateral)</b> - There are eight incisors located
                                                in the front of the mouth (four on the top and four on the bottom). They
                                                have sharp, chisel-shaped crowns that cut food.</li>

                                            <li><b>Cuspids / Canines</b> - The four cuspids are next to each incisor.
                                                Cuspids have a pointed edge to tear food.</li>

                                            <li><b>Premolars</b> - Also called bicuspids, the four pairs of premolars
                                                are located next to the cuspids. They crush and tear food.</li>

                                            <li><b>Molars</b> - There are twelve molars, in sets of three, at the back
                                                of the mouth. They have wide surfaces that help to grind food.</li>

                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Adults have 32 teeth. Depending on their age, children may have fewer because
                                            they lose baby teeth as adult teeth grow. In addition to chewing, teeth help
                                            you to speak clearly.</p>

                                        <p>Regular, thorough brushing is a very important step in preventing tooth decay
                                            and gum disease. Brushing removes the bacteria that promote tooth decay and
                                            the plaque that can cause gum disease.</p>

                                        <p>Ideally, you should brush after every meal, because the bacterial attack on
                                            teeth begins minutes after eating. At the very least, brush once a day and
                                            always before you go to bed. Brushing your teeth isn't complicated,
                                            but there is a right and a wrong way. We do it every day without thinking
                                            too much, but there are some important points to remember when brushing your
                                            teeth</p>

                                        <p><b>Here are a few tips to help your brush better:</b></p>

                                        <ol>

                                            <li>Squeeze some toothpaste onto a soft-bristled toothbrush. Your toothpaste
                                                should contain fluoride</li>

                                            <li>Use short, back-and-forth brushing motions to clean the outside and
                                                inside surfaces of the teeth, as well as the chewing surfaces. Follow
                                                with up-and-down motions to clean the inside surfaces of the front
                                                teeth.</li>

                                            <li>Clean every surface of every tooth.The chewing surface, the cheek side,
                                                and the tongue side.</li>

                                            <li>Don't rush your brush. A thorough brushing should take at least two to
                                                three minutes. Try timing yourself.</li>

                                            <li>Brush along the gum line. This is extremely important, as gum disease
                                                starts here. Brush gently to avoid damaging your gums.</li>

                                            <li>Make sure to brush your back molars, where bacteria like to hide.</li>

                                            <li>Brush your tongue to remove bacteria that cause bad breath.</li>

                                            <li>Spit out the toothpaste and rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash.
                                            </li>

                                            <li>Use a soft brush with rounded bristles. The right toothbrush cleans
                                                better. Choose a size and shape that allow you to reach all the way to
                                                your back teeth. There are many different types of brushes, so ask your
                                                dentist to suggest the best one for you. It is recommended you replace
                                                your toothbrush every three months.</li>

                                            <li>Try to floss at least once a day, since most adult cavities occur
                                                between teeth. The most important time to floss is before going to bed.
                                                Floss before or after you brush'either is fine. Guide the floss between
                                                the teeth and use it to gently rub the side of each tooth.</li>

                                        <p>Flossing removes plaque and bacteria that you cannot reach with your
                                            toothbrush. If you don't floss, you are missing more than one-third of your
                                            tooth surface. Plaque is the main cause of gum disease. It is an invisible
                                            bacterial film that develops on your teeth every day.</p>

                                        <p>Within 24 to 36 hours, plaque hardens into tartar (also called calculus)
                                            which can only be removed by professional cleaning. Floss at least once a
                                            day, and plaque never gets the chance to harden into tartar. Getting
                                            into the habit of daily flossing is easier when you floss while doing
                                            something else like watching TV or listening to music, for example.</p>

                                        <p>Here is the suggested way to floss right</p>

                                        <p>Step 1 - Take a length of floss equal to the distance from your hand to your
                                            shoulder. Wrap it around your index and middle fingers, leaving about two
                                            inches between your hands.</p>

                                        <p>Step 2 - Slide the floss between your teeth and wrap it into a "C" shape
                                            around the base of the tooth and gently under the gumline. Wipe the tooth
                                            from base to tip two or three times.</p>

                                        <p>Step 3 - Be sure to floss both sides of every tooth. Don't forget the backs
                                            of your last molars. Go to a new section of the floss as it wears and picks
                                            up particles.</p>

                                        <p>Step 4 - Brush your teeth after you floss — it is a more effective method of
                                            preventing tooth decay and gum disease.</p>

                                            variation of normal growth and development, which can affect the bite, the
                                            ability to clean teeth properly, gum tissue health, jaw growth,
                                            speech development and appearance.</p>

                                        <p><b>Some Types of Malocclusion:</b></p>

                                        <p>There are three basic categories of malocclusions.</p>

                                        <ul>

                                            <li>The first category consists of dental problems, in which the teeth (for
                                                various reasons) don’t have the correct position on their osseous base
                                                (dentoalveolus), and as a result they appear crowded, spaced or
                                                rotated. Usually these problems are not visible when the mouth is
                                                closed,.</li>

                                            <li>The second category consists of skeletal problems, where the jaws have
                                                not grown harmoniously and that in turn has a negative effect on the
                                                function of the mouth and the esthetics of the face. In this category
                                                the goal of orthodontic treatment is to correct the position of the
                                                teeth and restore the balance of the face.</li>

                                            <li>Finally, in the third category the patient has a combination of dental
                                                and skeletal problems, which not only affect the oral cavity but also
                                                the esthetics of the face.</li>

                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Teeth can slowly be moved and shifted into proper position by applying
                                            pressure in certain directions.</p>

                                        <ul>

                                            <li>Bands, Wires and elastics are placed on the teeth to move them in the
                                                right direction. This takes place slowly and carefully over an extended
                                                period of time.</li>

                                            <li>Shifting teeth back into a functional position can take months to years,
                                                but eventually you will have a new and improved mouth and a longer
                                                lasting smile</li>

                                            <li>Retainers are often used after the braces, to hold the teeth in their
                                                new position until they are stable.</li>

                                            <li>It is important to wear the braces or an appliance for however long the
                                                dentist suggests. If you quit at any point during the treatment, the
                                                teeth can shift back into their old position.

                                            <li>Braces collect food and dental plaque very easily. If proper oral
                                                hygiene is neglected during orthodontic treatment both tooth decay and
                                                periodontal disease can occur easily.</li>

                                            <li>It is very important to maintain a daily plaque control program. Such a
                                                program may be as follows:</li>

                                            <ul>

                                                <li>A soft toothbrush should be used. A special orthodontic toothbrush
                                                    can also be used to brush your teeth.</li>

                                                <li>Flossing with braces on takes more time than usual. Superfloss or
                                                    floss threaders can aid in flossing, and make it more time
                                                    efficient.</li>

                                                <li>An interdental brush can be used to fit between the wire and the
                                                    tooth to remove hard-to-reach plaque and food debris.</li>

                                                <li>Oral irrigators can be used along with brushing and flossing. This

                                                <li>A mouthwash containing fluoride can be used to help prevent cavities
                                                    from occurring.</li>

                                                <li>Hard foods should be avoided since they can bend the wires, loosen
                                                    the bands, or break the brackets (braces). Fruits and raw vegetables
                                                    should be cut up into smaller pieces and chewed on the back teeth.
                                                </li>

                                                <li>Sticky foods such as chewing gum, hard candies, & toffees should be

                                        <p><b>What is root canal treatment?</b></p>

                                        <p>Root canal treatment, also known as endodontic treatment, is a dental
                                            procedure in which the diseased or damaged pulp (core) of a tooth is removed
                                            and the inside areas (the pulp chamber and root canals) are filled
                                            and sealed.</p>

                                        <p><b>Why do I need it?</b></p>

                                        <p>The pulp, or soft inner tissue of your tooth, is normally surrounded and
                                            protected by a layer of dentin. Above the gumline, a layer of enamel
                                            protects the dentin; below the gumline, the dentin is covered by cementum.
                                            When a deep cavity, decay or crack destroys these protective layers, the
                                            pulp is exposed to the bacteria in your mouth. This can result in
                                            inflammation, infection and, eventually, necrosis (pulp death). A severe
                                            blow to the tooth can also damage the pulp. Irritants may then escape from
                                            the end of the root and cause a diseased area (apical lesion) in the bone.
                                            Pus accumulates at the ends of the roots, forming a painful
                                            abscess (Pus filled cavity usually seen in this condition in side the
                                            mouth), which can damage the bone supporting the teeth. Such an infection
                                            may produce pain that is severe, constant, or throbbing, as well
                                            as prolonged sensitivity to heat or cold, swelling and tenderness in the
                                            surrounding gums, facial swelling, and discoloration of the tooth. However,
                                            in some cases, the pulp may die so gradually that there is
                                            little noticeable pain.</p>

                                        <p>Root canal treatment removes the damaged pulp and irritants. This allows the
                                            bone surrounding the root end to repair and heal.</p>

                                        <p>You could get it removed, but then adjoining teeth may shift and interfere
                                            with biting and chewing. You can have a replacement tooth implanted or
                                            attached to adjacent healthy teeth, but this can be expensive and
                                            require even more dental treatment. There is no real substitute for your own
                                            natural tooth, which is more efficient in chewing and biting than an
                                            artificial one.</p>

                                        <p><b>What happens during root canal treatment?</b></p>

                                        <p>An examination, including X-rays, will be performed. A local anesthetic will
                                            be given, if necessary. A sheet of rubber latex, called a “rubber dam,”
                                            will/may be placed around the tooth to isolate it and keep it
                                            clean and dry during treatment.</p>

                                        <p><b>Complete root canal treatment usually consists of the following five basic
                                                steps:</b></p>

                                        <p><img class="img-responsive img-center"
                                                src="img/general_dentistry/crown_opened.png" alt="Crown Opened" />Step
                                            1. An opening is made in the crown of the tooth. Creating this access also
                                            relieves the pressure inside
                                            the tooth and can dramatically ease pain.</p>

                                        <p><img class="img-responsive img-center"
                                                src="img/general_dentistry/pulp_removed_and_root_canals_cleaned.png"
                                                alt="Pulp Removed And Root Canals Cleaned" />Step 2. The pulp is removed
                                            from the pulp chamber and root
                                            canals. The dentist determines the length of the root canals, usually with a
                                            series of X-rays. Tiny instruments (“files”) are used to clean the root
                                            canals and shape them to a form that will ensure they will
                                            be well sealed. A temporary filling is placed in the opening to seal the
                                            opening and protect the tooth between appointments.</p>

                                        <p><img class="img-responsive img-center"
                                                src="img/general_dentistry/root_canals_filled_and_sealed.png"
                                                alt="Root Canals Filled And Sealed" />Step 3. The root canals are filled
                                            and sealed with a material that prevents
                                            bacteria from re-entering. The opening in the crown of the tooth is sealed
                                            with a temporary filling. Radiographs (X-rays) are made before, during and
                                            after treatment.</p>

                                        <p><img class="img-responsive img-center"
                                                src="img/general_dentistry/tooth_permanently_restored.png"
                                                alt="Tooth Permanently Restored" />Step 4. At the next appointment, the
                                            temporary filling will be replaced with a
                                            permanent filling and then with a ceramic / porcelain crown. <br />

                                            <b>Root canal treatment is not complete without the placement of a
                                                crown.</b>
                                        </p>

                                            The root canal, permanent filling, and/or crown are evaluated for healing at
                                            periodic intervals called
                                            recall appointments.</p>

                                        <p><b>Is this procedure going to hurt?</b></p>

                                        <p>With modern techniques and anesthetics people report that having a root canal
                                            treatment is about as painless as having a cavity filled. Should you
                                            experience any discomfort, call your dentist, who will do everything
                                            possible to make you comfortable.</p>

                                        <p><b>What care should be taken after the root canal treatment?</b></p>

                                        <p>The tooth may be sore or you may experience pain/discomfort for several days
                                            after the filling. Pain relievers, may be taken to ease the soreness as
                                            prescribed by the dentist. The tissues around the tooth may also
                                            be irritated. Rinsing the mouth with warm salt water several times a day
                                            will help. Chewing on that side of the mouth may need to be avoided for the
                                            first few days following treatment. A follow-up appointment
                                            should be scheduled with the dentist for six months after treatment to make
                                            sure the tooth and surrounding structures are healthy.</p>

                                        <p><b>How long will my teeth last after this treatment?</b></p>

                                        <p>Although the pulp is removed, your tooth remains alive, nourished by
                                            surrounding bone and gum tissues. With a permanent restoration (crown),
                                            regular brushing and flossing, proper diet and periodic dental checkups,
                                            your tooth has an excellent chance for success.</p>

                                            <p>Most patients experience a little soreness after the appointment. This
                                                may be due to the injection, the necessity of keeping the mouth open for
                                                a long time, or the treatment. Your temporary filling will be hard
                                                enough to bite on within approximately a half-hour, but avoid biting or
                                                chewing on the treated tooth if it hurts.</p>

                                            <p>When your root canal treatment is complete, a temporary filling is
                                                placed. The tooth needs to be permanently restored to prevent
                                                contamination or fracture, so you will need to return for a permanent
                                                restoration.
                                                It is important to return promptly because the temporary filling can
                                                loosen and leak, possibly causing the root canal treatment to fail,

                                            As always, when considering any medical procedure, you should get as much
                                            information as you can about all of your options. Your dentist

                                        <p><b>Myth #1: Root Canal treatment is Painful</b></p>

                                        <p><b>Truth</b>—Root canal treatment doesn't cause pain, it relieves it.Most
                                            patients see their dentist or endodontist when they have a severe toothache.
                                            Damaged tissues in the tooth can cause the toothache. Root canal
                                            treatment removes this damaged tissue from the tooth, thereby relieving the
                                            pain you that you feel.</p>

                                        <p>The perception of root canals being painful began decades ago when root canal
                                            treatment was painful. But with the latest technologies and anesthetics,
                                            root canal treatment today is as easy / comfortable like having
                                            a filling placed. In fact, a recent survey showed that patients who have
                                            experienced root canal treatment are six times more likely to describe it as
                                            "painless" than patients who have not had root canal treatment.</p>

                                        <p><b>Myth #2 : Root canal Treatment Causes Illness (Fever)</b></p>

                                        <p><b>Truth</b>—Root canal treatment is a safe and effective procedure.</p>

                                        <p>Research conducted over the years showed no relationship between root canal
                                            treated teeth and the presence of illness(Fever). Instead, researchers found
                                            that people with root canal fillings were no more likely to
                                            be ill than people without them.</p>

                                        <p>The presence of bacteria in teeth and mouth has been an accepted fact for
                                            many years. But presence of bacteria does not necessarily mean there should
                                            be "infection" and is not necessarily a threat to a person's
                                            health. Bacteria are present in the mouth and teeth at all times, even in
                                            teeth that have never had a cavity or other trauma.</p>

                                        <p>One of the causes for illness in earlier days may be due to improper
                                            sterilization procedures. But in modern day dentistry today sterilization if
                                            all instruments is of utmost priority which has almost totally eradicated
                                            the event of causing illness.</p>

                                        <p>It is now well known that teeth that receive proper root canal treatment do
                                            not cause illness.</p>

                                        <p><b>Myth #3—A good alternative to root canal treatment is extraction (pulling

                                        <p>Truth—Saving your natural teeth, if possible, is the very best option.</p>

                                        <p>Nothing can completely replace your natural tooth. An artificial tooth can
                                            sometimes cause you to avoid certain foods. Keeping your own teeth is
                                            important so that you can continue to enjoy the wide variety of foods
                                            necessary to maintain the proper nutrient balance in your diet.</p>

                                        <p>Root Canal treatment, along with appropriate permanent restoration (cap or
                                            crown), is a cost-effective way to treat teeth with damaged pulp and is
                                            usually less expensive than extraction and placement of a bridge
                                            or an implant.</p>

                                        <p>Root Canal treatment also has a very high success rate. Many root canal
                                            treated teeth last a lifetime.</p>

                                        <p>Placement of a bridge or an implant will require significantly more time in
                                            treatment and may result in further procedures to adjacent teeth and
                                            supporting tissues.</p>

                                        <p>Millions of properly root canal treated teeth serve patients all over the

                                        <p>Gingivitis is inflammation of the gum tissue. The gums are irritated and
                                            swollen due to a plaque or calculus (tartar) buildup along the gumline. The
                                            gums may be sore, bleed easily and appear puffy, soft and swollen.
                                            No bone structure is lost around the teeth at this stage of gum disease.
                                            Blood on the toothbrush or dental floss is one of the earliest and most
                                            common signs of gingivitis. Your gums should never bleed while
                                            brushing or flossing. The good news about gingivitis is that it is
                                            preventable and reversible through good brushing and flossing techniques (or
                                            other interdental tooth cleansing). On the other hand, if oral
                                            hygiene habits are poor, gingivitis may progress to Periodontitis.</p>

                                            permanent alternative to problem dentures, and help prevent the premature

                                        <p><b>Q: What are dental implants?</b></p>

                                        <p>A: Dental implants are made of biocompatible materials that become directly
                                            attached to your jawbone. In dental terms, this is called
                                            “osseointegration.” Once anchored in place, your implants can be used to
                                            replace
                                            a missing tooth, support an entire set of teeth or retain an overdenture.
                                            The result is a natural type of tooth replacement that can restore the
                                            biting and chewing ability you once enjoyed, improve your appearance
                                            and renew your self-confidence.</p>

                                        <p><b>Q: What procedures are used to insert dental implants?</b></p>

                                        <p>A: Placement of dental implants is a minor surgical procedure performed in
                                            one or two office visits. If you have one-stage implants, their metal tops
                                            will extend through the gums while your tissues heal, and you
                                            will not need a second surgery. If you have two-stage implants, they will be
                                            placed under the gums while the bone heals. You will need a second, simple
                                            surgery to uncover them and attach a post to support your
                                            replacement teeth. Your dentist’s decision to do a one- or two-stage
                                            surgical procedure depends on a number of clinical factors, such as the
                                            amount of available bone and location of the implants. After the implants
                                            are placed, the bone attaches to them and permanently anchors them within
                                            your jaw. In the meantime, your dentist may adjust your full denture or
                                            partial prosthesis for temporary use.</p>

                                        <p>These are not extra teeth like most of us think. They are part of our normal
                                            set of teeth. Each one of us has 32 teeth. 28 would have erupted into the
                                            mouth by the time we are 13 years of age. The last four, one
                                            in each end of the upper and lower jaws are the wisdom teeth. There is a
                                            sequence of eruption and it just so happens that the wisdom teeth are the
                                            last ones to erupt at the age of 18 to 24 years of age. By then
                                            there is usually a lack of space for them to erupt properly and so most are
                                            always stuck(IMPACTED). So we always have this idea that they are extras!

                                        <p><b>Do we need to remove them?</b></p>

                                        <p>There criteria most Dental Surgeons will have to determine whether that
                                            wisdom tooth of yours need to be removed.</p>

                                        <p>These are:</p>

                                        <ul>

                                            <li>They have given you gum pains before. These pains will usually subside
                                                after some medications and then will recur at a later date. No one can
                                                predict the frequency and severity of these recurring pains. They
                                                may or may not be accompanied by swelling and pustulent products.</li>

                                            <li>They have caused cavities in the teeth in front of them due to food
                                                trapping or they themselves have cavities from food trappings. These are
                                                usually determined by the dental surgeons after a check up or through
                                                x-rays results.</li>

                                            <li>They interfere with the treatment you are having. Usually this will
                                                happen in those who seek braces treatment.</li>

                                            <li>They are constant causes of food trapping and irritation.</li>

                                        </ul>

                                        <p><b>What is an Impacted Wisdom Tooth ?</b></p>

                                        <p>A tooth becomes impacted due to lack of space in the dental arch and its
                                            eruption is therefore prevented by gum, bone, another tooth or all three.
                                            Lack of space occurs because our jaws have become smaller (through
                                            evolution), we do not loose teeth through decay as frequently as in the
                                            past, and our diet is such that our teeth do not wear down as much.</p>

                                            </b>How are they removed?</b>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>There are two methods of removing wisdom teeth. They can be by simple
                                            extraction or they are removed by simple minor surgical procedures. These
                                            are determined by their degree of impaction.</p>

                                        <p>Removing wisdom teeth either by extraction or surgery can be performed under
                                            local anaesthesia or under general anaesthesia.</p>

                                        <p>Local anaesthesia means that they can be done in the clinic when you are
                                            fully awake or sedated.</p>

                                        <p>General anaesthesia will mean removing them while you are asleep and is
                                            usually done in a hospital environment under Day Surgery.ie. you go home
                                            about four hours after the procedure is performed. These can be carried
                                            out either in the private hospitals or restructured hospitals. The surgeons
                                            can be private practitioners or from government service.</p>

                                        <p><b>The healing process begins</b> immediately after surgery as your body
                                            sends blood to nourish the tooth socket. Simple pressure from a piece of
                                            gause is usually all that is needed to control the bleeding and to
                                            help a blood clot to form in the socket, which promotes healing. Within a
                                            day or two, soft tissue begins to fill in the socket, aided by the blood
                                            clot. Eventually, the bone surrounding the socket begins to
                                            grow, eventually filling in the socket completely, as illustrated here:</p>

                                        <ul>

                                            <li>Wisdom teeth may be hard to access with your toothbrush or floss. Over
                                                time, the accumulation of bacteria, sugars and acids may cause a cavity
                                                to form in the tooth. If it is not restored with a filling, the
                                                cavity may spread and destroy more tooth structure causing severe
                                                consequences to the tooth and surrounding supportive structures.</li>

                                            <li>Due to the difficulty of keeping these teeth clean with your daily home
                                                care (brushing and flossing), bacteria and food debris remaining on the
                                                wisdom teeth may produce a foul smell-causing bad breath.</li>

                                            <li>A wisdom tooth that is still under the gums in a horizontal position
                                                (rather than a vertical position) may exert pressure to the surrounding
                                                teeth, causing crowding and crooked teeth. This also may occur if
                                                there is not enough space in the mouth for the wisdom tooth. This may
                                                warrant braces to repair the damage.</li>

                                            <li>A wisdom tooth that is still under the gums may become irritated. The
                                                gum tissue that lays over the tooth may harbor food debris and bacteria
                                                that gets trapped under the gum, resulting in an infection in the
                                                gums.</li>

                                        </ul>

                                        <p><b>Some Con's of Removing the Wisdom Teeth:</b></p>

                                        <ul>

                                            <li>Depending on the size shape and position of the tooth, removal can vary
                                                from a simple extraction to a more complex extraction. With a simple
                                                extraction, there is usually little swelling, bruising and/or bleeding.
                                                More complex extraction will require special treatment, which may result
                                                in more bruising, swelling and bleeding. However, your dental
                                                professional will provide you with post treatment instructions to
                                                minimize
                                                these side effects.</li>

                                            <li>Following an extraction, a condition called "dry socket" may occur. If
                                                the blood clot that formed in the extraction area becomes dislodged, it
                                                exposes the underlying bone. This condition is very painful, but
                                                resolves after a few days. It is preventable by following the post
                                                treatment instructions provided by your dental professional.</li>

                                            <li>The longer you wait and the older you get, there is the potential for
                                                more problems to occur. This is because as you get older, the bone
                                                surrounding the tooth becomes more dense, making the tooth more
                                                difficult
                                                to remove. The healing process may also be slower.</li>

                                        <p>The best way to keep your teeth white is to brush twice a day, floss daily,
                                            see your dentist for regular checkups and professional cleanings, and limit
                                            stain-causing foods and habits. These include: tobacco, certain
                                            foods and beverages (such as coffee, tea and berries), some drugs (such as
                                            tetracycline), or trauma to a tooth. As well, your teeth may become stained
                                            or discoloured naturally as you age. Your dentist can give
                                            you the best advice about whitening your teeth.</p>

                                        <p>HERE'S HOW IT'S DONE: Chairside bleaching - usually takes about 30 to 60
                                            minutes and one to three visits to the dental office. A shield (or rubber
                                            dam) protects your gums from the bleaching agent (usually a form
                                            of hydrogen peroxide), which is "painted" onto your discolored teeth and
                                            activated with heat or high-intensity light.</p>

                                            also rectify crowded or overlapping teeth. If your teeth have discolored
                                            with age, a veneer may improve their appearance. Veneers can also be used
                                            for cosmetic reasons instead of crowns, which are more often
                                            used for badly damaged or decayed teeth.</p>

                                        <p>HERE'S HOW IT'S DONE: The tooth needs to be ground down and the veneer
                                            replaces the ground off surface. Veneer preparations frequently require the
                                            use of local anaesthetic and, depending on color and shade, may
                                            take two or more appointments to complete. Ask your dentist if veneers can
                                            help improve your smile.</p>

                                        <p>The best way to keep your teeth white is to brush twice a day, floss daily,
                                            see your dentist for regular checkups and professional cleanings, and limit
                                            stain-causing foods and habits. These include: tobacco, certain
                                            foods and beverages (such as coffee, tea and berries), some drugs (such as
                                            tetracycline), or trauma to a tooth. As well, your teeth may become stained
                                            or discoloured naturally as you age. Your dentist can give
                                            you the best advice about whitening your teeth.</p>

                                        <p>As children reach their teen years, the appearance of their teeth can do much
                                            to promote a healthy self image and confidence.</p>

                                        <p>Unfortunately, sometimes minor injuries occur, or cavities develop in front
                                            teeth, and in the past, the only solution was to fix or fill with typical
                                            amalgam, or go through an expensive capping or crowning process
                                            in order to restore the teeth to a more natural appearance.</p>

                                        <p>Modern technology has changed this. Cosmetic bonding is basically the process
                                            of filling or fixing teeth with a tooth-colored filling material in order to
                                            maintain appearance by way of a beautiful and natural smile.
                                            Tooth-colored fillings are made from durable plastics called composite
                                            resins. Similar in color and texture to natural teeth, the fillings are much
                                            less noticeable and much more attractive than other types of
                                            fillings.</p>

                                        <p>Your child can smile, talk, and eat with confidence. In addition,
                                            tooth-colored fillings are compatible with dental sealants, and a tooth can
                                            be filled and sealed at the same time to prevent further decay.</p>

                                        <p>Tooth colored fillings may not work in every case, but for typical fillings
                                            and small restorations where appearance is important, can do wonders to
                                            provide a natural appearance and confident smile in your child.</p>

                                        <p>Care for cosmetic fillings are the same as normal care, brushing, flossing,
                                            and regular dental visits. We will regularly check the fillings or repair
                                            for color change, leakage, or unusual wear and inform you of
                                            the need for repair or replacement.</p>

                                        <p>Did you know that about 30% of adults over age 65 no longer have any natural
                                            teeth?! Tooth loss is more common in older folks who didn't have the benefit
                                            of growing up with fluoride (a mineral that helps keep teeth
                                            healthy and strong) in their water and other advances in dental care.</p>

                                        <p>People usually need dentures because they've lost teeth due to:</p>

                                        <p>periodontal (say: per-ee-oh-dahn-tel) disease, or gum disease, which is
                                            caused by a buildup of plaque (a film that sticks to your teeth) and
                                            bacteria that attacks the gums.</p>

                                        <p>tooth decay (cavities), which happens in older adults more often because gums
                                            recede (become soft and worn down) as people age.</p>

                                        <p>These problems get worse over time, especially if a person doesn't take care
                                            of his/her teeth, doesn't regularly see a dentist for cleanings and tooth
                                            care, or has health complications like diabetes or stroke. Some
                                            medications that older people may need to take every day can dry out the
                                            mouth and prevent good saliva flow, which is important in washing away food
                                            debris and keeping the mouth healthy.</p>

                                        <p>So, what can you do to prevent anyone you know - as well as yourself - from
                                            needing dentures in the future? Take care of your teeth and urge other kids
                                            and adults you know to do so, too! Here's how:</p>

                                        <p>Carefully and gently brush your teeth twice a day with a toothpaste
                                            containing fluoride. Use a toothbrush with soft bristles, and try to
                                            remember not to brush too hard, which can cause gums to recede. If your

                                            is all bent out of shape from the way you're brushing, then you're brushing
                                            too hard!</p>

                                        <p>Don't know how long to brush? Put on your favorite song. You should brush
                                            almost as long as the song.</p>

                                        <p>Be sure to floss your teeth at least once a day.</p>

                                        <p>Visit the dentist twice a year for a professional cleaning and checkup. Tell
                                            the dentist if you are experiencing gum pain or swollen gums or if your gums
                                            bleed when you brush.</p>

                                        <p>Don't drink or smoke. Smoking or chewing tobacco increases the risk of gum
                                            disease. Alone or paired with alcohol, tobacco increases the risk of throat
                                            and mouth cancers.</p>

                                        <p>Drink plenty of water (six to eight glasses a day) and avoid sugary snacks
                                            and soft drinks between meals.</p>

                                        <p>Complete dentures replace all of the natural teeth in the upper or lower jaw,
                                            or both, sitting on the soft (gum) tissue of the mouth that covers the bone
                                            ridge. Your dentist may use several different procedures
                                            to make sure your denture will fit the shape of your mouth, and provide the
                                            necessary support for your face. The design of the complete denture and
                                            position of the teeth will restore good speech and appearance.</p>

                                        <p>Types of complete dentures</p>

                                        <p>A full denture, also called a complete denture, replaces natural teeth and
                                            provides support for cheeks and lips. Without support from the denture,
                                            facial muscles can sag, making a person look much older. There are
                                            the following types of complete dentures:</p>

                                        <p>Conventional full denture: after patient's remaining teeth are removed and
                                            the gum tissues have healed, this kind of denture is made and placed inside
                                            the mouth. The process for tissue healing may take months.</p>

                                        <p>Immediate full denture: The denture wearer does not have to wait during the
                                            healing period because after teeth removal, this kind of denture is made and
                                            inserted into patient's mouth.</p>

                                        <p>How are dentures made?</p>

                                        <p>Your dentist will take an impression of your jaw, along with measurements of
                                            how your jaws relate to one another and how much space is between them (bite
                                            relationship). The color (shade) of your teeth will also
                                            be determined either from your natural teeth or a denture you may already be
                                            wearing. The impression, bite and shade are given to the dental laboratory
                                            so a denture can be made just for you.</p>

                                        <p>The dental laboratory makes a mold (model) of your jaw, places the teeth in a
                                            wax base, and carves the wax to the exact form wanted in the finished
                                            denture. Usually a "wax try-in" of the denture will be done at
                                            the DENTAL CLINIC so any adjustments can be done before the denture is
                                            completed.</p>

                                        <p>The denture is completed at the dental laboratory using the "lost wax"
                                            technique. A mold of the wax-up denture is made, the wax is removed and the
                                            remaining space is filled with pink plastic in dough form. The mold
                                            is then heated to harden the plastic. The denture is then polished and ready
                                            for the patient to wear.</p>

                                        <p>Wearing Your Dentures</p>

                                        <p>It usually takes a little while to get used to wearing a full denture. There
                                            may also be minor adjustments that your dentist will make to fine tune the
                                            fit of your denture. After a few weeks, you will be more at
                                            ease and your gums adapted to wearing a full denture.</p>

                                        <p>It is very important that you wear your denture every day. If you don't wear
                                            your denture for an extended period of time, the denture may no longer fit
                                            as well as it should.</p>

                                        <p>Over time, your mouth will change. The bone and gum areas may shrink or
                                            recede, causing the space between the jaws to change. Because your denture
                                            keeps its shape, adjustments will be needed to keep your denture
                                            fitting properly. Always consult your dentist rather than trying to fix the
                                            problem yourself. Trying to adjust them yourself will only cause more
                                            difficulties and what may have started out as a small problem
                                            could easily become a bigger one.</p>

                                        <p>Getting Used to Your Denture</p>

                                        <p>It will take a bit of time to get used to your new denture, particularly if
                                            it is your first. Unfortunately, a complete denture will not feel like your
                                            teeth did when you had them. They should, however, become comfortable
                                            and functional with time.</p>

                                        <p>Speaking- At first you will have some difficulty with speaking and this is to
                                            be expected. Some people describe this as trying to talk with a "mouth full
                                            of marbles". Be patient; you will quickly adapt with practice
                                            and soon you will find you can not speak properly without your denture.
                                            There is no way to predict how long this will take, each patient adapts at a
                                            different rate.</p>

                                        <p>Eating- Eating takes practice as well. The important thing to remember is
                                            that you do not chew with your denture as you did when you had teeth.
                                            Natural teeth chew in an up and down motion. Denture teeth, on the
                                            other hand, use a side to side motion to mash down the food. Always cut your
                                            food into small pieces for more effective denture chewing. It is
                                            unpredictable how well you will adapt to eating. Some patients can
                                            chew just about anything whereas others find they are limited in how well
                                            they can chew. All patients, however do improve with practice, time, and a
                                            bit of patience.</p>

                                        <p>Denture Fit- Your denture will "settle in" in a short time and should fit
                                            well. The dentist will gladly adjust for any sore areas that may develop.do
                                            not stop wearing them if soreness develops,it needs adjustments.
                                            Report this to the dentist immediately. Upper dentures usually fit snugly
                                            and stay in with suction. The lower denture, however, does not develop this
                                            suction due to the different shape of the lower jaw. The
                                            lower tends to "float". You will learn with time how to help hold the lower
                                            stable by the way you use your mouth while eating, speaking, and resting.
                                            Once again, this takes time and it is not possible to predict
                                            how well each patient will adapt. Denture adhesives can help but it is
                                            recommended you not use them during the first few weeks of wearing your new
                                            denture.</p>

                                        <p>How to Care for Your Denture</p>

                                        <p>Keep your denture clean by brushing it with denture cleaning paste at least
                                            once a day. Do this over a sink filled with water to prevent breakage in
                                            case you drop the denture.</p>

                                        <p>Take your denture out every night when you go to sleep. Place it in some
                                            water in the box or cup with water Letting your denture dry out by not
                                            storing in a cup of water will slightly change it's shape enough to
                                            adversely effect the fit.</p>

                                        <p>Occasionally soak your denture in a commercial denture cleansing product
                                            which your dentist may prescribe to help disinfect it</p>

                                        <p>Rinse your mouth with mouthwash (without the denture) at least once a day to
                                            keep your mouth clean. This helps cut down on the amount of bacteria and
                                            fungus in the mouth which can lead to bad breath, denture sores,
                                            and infections.</p>

                                        <p>Make an appointment as soon as you develop any sores, change in fit, or any
                                            other problem you would like us to address.</p>

                                        <p>The Life of your Dentures</p>

                                        <p>Proper care and cleaning will increase the life of your dentures. Although
                                            they typically last five years, proper care and minimal jaw recession can
                                            extend the life of dentures up to 25 years. Dentures should be
                                            cleaned daily with a normal or specially-made denture toothpaste. In the
                                            case of tissue/bone shrinkage, worn down teeth, or breakage, dentures may
                                            come loose and need to be remade.</p>

                                            <p>Many decades ago unqualified dentists (quacks) provided certain dental
                                                treatment that was not based on scientific principles and along with
                                                this kind of assumption based treatment, myths developed which became
                                                imprinted in people's minds. Dentistry today is an advanced specialized
                                                branch of medical science based on scientific facts. Research in dental
                                                science has led to better understanding of oral diseases and
                                                a systematic approach to treatment based on facts became established.
                                                This advancement in dental science has only reduced the myths and not
                                                completely eliminated it from the minds of the people. In this
                                                article few of the myths, which still exist, are presented along with
                                                their related facts for people to understand.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - Removal of upper teeth affects vision.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - There is a myth among many people that removal of the upper teeth
                                                affects vision. This is a misconception. Vision is not affected in any
                                                way by undertaking treatment of the upper teeth including its
                                                extraction.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - An artificial set of teeth or complete denture that is made once
                                                is forever.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - While it is true that well fitting dentures are used by the
                                                patient for many years, it is a myth that it can be retained forever.
                                                The oral tissues that lie below the dentures change over a period of
                                                time.
                                                But the dentures are made of stiff materials that do not adapt according
                                                to the changing contours of the oral tissues. Thus even a well fitting
                                                denture may not fit well after a few years. If an ill-fitting
                                                denture is continued to be worn, it can cause damage to the underlying
                                                tissues. Thus most dentists’ advice changing of the dentures once in at
                                                least 5 years.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - Professional cleaning/scaling/removal of tartar loosens the teeth.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Fact - Teeth are held firmly by the supporting tissues of the
                                                periodontium including bone. Bad oral hygiene results in the deposition
                                                of tartar /calculus on the tooth surface. These deposits irritate the
                                                gums
                                                and can cause inflammation and bleeding of the gums. If the tartar is
                                                not removed, the gums may recede and the supporting bone around the
                                                teeth gets destroyed. The tartar on the teeth thus causes great harm
                                                to the supporting tissues of the teeth. However, patients may experience
                                                slight mobility of the teeth after tartar is removed as it kind of binds
                                                the teeth together. Professional cleaning removes this tartar
                                                and arrests further destruction of supporting bone. Removal of tartar
                                                deposits only helps to recover the health of supporting structures. This
                                                chain of events does not take place in people who have dental
                                                checkup regularly.</p>

                                            <p>Myth- Dental procedures are always painful.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - Most dental procedures are carried out if the need arises under
                                                local anesthesia, which makes the procedures totally painless. In
                                                addition the modern day high-speed drills cause less vibrations and are
                                                more comfortable for the patients.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - Dental treatment should be avoided during pregnancy.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - The above notion is not true. Many a times dental treatment is
                                                provided even during late pregnancy. Routine dental procedures can be
                                                carried out without any fear. However, some major surgical procedure
                                                may require medical opinion before treatment. Dental X-rays are to be
                                                avoided during the first three months of pregnancy.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - Cleaning the teeth with finger & powder is better than with
                                                toothbrush.</p>

                                            <p>Fact – The use of a toothbrush with bristles is to clean plaque and food
                                                particles from almost all the surfaces of the teeth. The finger may not
                                                reach all the areas as well as a brush does. Hence, it is recommended
                                                to use a toothbrush with paste to clean the teeth and freshen the mouth.
                                                Finger can only be used to massage the gums after brushing is complete.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Myth - Charcoal, salt, rice husk, tobacco, etc, in powder form is better
                                                than toothpaste in cleaning teeth.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - The objective of cleaning the teeth is to remove the plaque and
                                                food particles on and around the teeth by the bristles of a toothbrush
                                                with the help of a toothpaste or powder. A standard paste or powder
                                                contains proper sized particles, which are not harmful to the teeth.
                                                However, other powders are coarse and can erode the outer layer of the
                                                teeth and permanently damage them. Hence, only standard toothpaste
                                                or powder should be used with a toothbrush. Toothpaste is better than
                                                powder as it can easily be dispensed on the brush and it may contain
                                                fluorides, anti-tartar chemicals, etc. The foaming action of the
                                                toothpaste also helps to freshen the mouth. Tobacco should not be used.
                                                Users enjoy the euphoric effect of nicotine present in tobacco rather
                                                than cleaning of the teeth and slowly become addicted to it.
                                                Hence, it should never be used.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - Thumb sucking by children leads to forward placement of upper
                                                teeth.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - Thumb sucking is a normal infant habit, which makes the child feel
                                                secure and happy. It usually decreases after the age of 3 years.
                                                However, if the habit persists beyond the age of 4-5 years it can cause
                                                problems of the teeth including forward placement of the teeth. In these
                                                children, depending upon the frequency and severity of the habit an
                                                intervention of the habit by a dental surgeon may be required.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - A child never needs cleaning of milk teeth.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - It is a myth that we need not clean a child's teeth. Children are
                                                as much prone for dental decay or gum diseases as adults. In fact
                                                children tend to have sweet food including sweetened milk and juices,
                                                which can promote dental decay. So it is advisable to start the habit of
                                                cleaning the infant's teeth soon after they appear in the mouth. In fact
                                                it is advised to clean baby’s gum pads everyday by gentle
                                                massage even before the teeth erupt.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - Milk teeth need not be cared for because they last only for a few
                                                years, and these teeth will anyway be replaced by permanent teeth.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - Early loss of milk teeth will interfere with chewing and affect
                                                the child’s nutrition. Early loss of milk teeth leads to drifting of the
                                                adjacent teeth and closure of some of the space that is required
                                                for the succeeding permanent teeth to erupt into. Such a loss of space
                                                will cause the permanent teeth to erupt in irregular position and result
                                                in crowding. Therefore milk teeth need to be cared for as much
                                                as permanent teeth.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - When the gums bleed, it is better not to brush the teeth.</p>

                                            <p>Fact -Bleeding of gums is a sign that they are inflamed and are not
                                                healthy. This usually is a result of plaque and food particles
                                                accumulating around the teeth. Until this collection is removed, the
                                                gums continue
                                                to bleed. This is an indication that the individual needs to visit a
                                                dentist for opinion and treatment. Brushing the teeth with a soft
                                                toothbrush by the proper technique removes the plaque and helps the
                                                gums recover. Initial bleeding seen during brushing gradually reduces
                                                over a period of time.</p>

                                            <p>Myth – Keeping an aspirin tablet beside a painful tooth reduces the tooth
                                                pain.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - A toothache cannot be relieved by placing an aspirin tablet
                                                anywhere in the mouth. In fact this is a dangerous habit as it causes
                                                burns of the soft tissues around the area of placement. Hence, aspirin
                                                tablets should not be placed in mouth but swallowed after eating some
                                                food to relieve the pain.</p>

                                            <p>Myth - When an artificial set of teeth are worn, the upper denture
                                                logically has to fall down in the mouth and create problems, however the
                                                lower denture that should rest in place does not stay.</p>

                                            <p>Fact - Although the lower denture rests on the ridges of jaw, it does get
                                                easily dislodged because of the interference of the muscles of check,
                                                lips tongue and movement of the jaw during function. However, with
                                                time the muscles learn to co-ordinate with the lower denture and the
                                                patient overcomes this problem. The upper denture, on the other hand
                                                stays in its place due to creation of suction under the palate</p>

                                        <p>Hi, I'm Dr. Karthik.Welcome to the "KIDS CLINIC".I assure you that your stay
                                            here will be a pleasant one. At our clinic I have had the privilege of
                                            providing dental care to some of the finest children to be found
                                            anywhere. As a Pediatric Dentist, I feel strongly about the importance and
                                            advantages of introducing kids to the dentist at a very young age.
                                            Youngsters that begin their dental visits around age one will learn
                                            to accept dental care more readily and with less apprehension. By starting
                                            children very young, many dental problems can also be prevented by early
                                            intervention.</p>

                                        <p>Please explore our site, particualry this section, with your children if
                                            possible. It has been constructed with them in mind to provide information,
                                            education, and to answer many questions you may have about children's
                                            dental problems and how to effectively address them.</p>

                                        <p>"There is no parental concern about a child that is too small to be
                                            unimportant."</p>

                                        <p>If my office can be of assistance to you, please feel free to call or email
                                            us: drkarthik@vibhadental.com .I will answer your question or e-mail you an

                                        <p>In working with children, I have discovered many things about them as
                                            patients that make them more special to me each and every day. Children are
                                            such special gifts, and rather than look at them as children, we
                                            view them as "Little People". And just like "Big People", they respond
                                            readily to compliment, encouragement, recognition, and responsibility! They
                                            bring such an innocence and such a desire to please into our
                                            environment.</p>

                                        <p>Our first goal in treating your child is to make your child a friend, and the
                                            best way we have found of doing this is to make your child feel good about
                                            themselves. So as we work with children, we emphasize to the
                                            child that they, with their cooperation and grown-up behavior (yes, even 3
                                            year olds), are the reason it was so easy to fix their tooth. By giving the
                                            child the credit for the success, it gives them recognition
                                            as a person.</p>

                                        <p>We have found this approach makes children proud of themselves and elevates
                                            their self image. Often our "little people" volunteer to show the next child
                                            how it's done. We explain that since they are one of our "best
                                            helpers" we will let "Johnny"(perhaps a new and apprehensive patient) watch
                                            them to see how the big boys and girls get their teeth fixed. And they love
                                            the responsibility being entrusted to them! Often, we will
                                            coach the child to explain, "Dr. Karthik put my teeth to sleep with sleepy
                                            water and it didn't even hurt"! Sleepy water is of course the local
                                            anaesthetic to you and I.</p>

                                        <p>In choosing a dentist for your child, we realize your primary concern as
                                            parents is that your child will undergo treatment without fear and pain.
                                            That is our primary goal too. We often find that parents are more
                                            apprehensive than their children, and many times bring "Apprehensive Parent"
                                            into the treatment area so they can witness their child undergoing treatment
                                            without the fear they themselves may have experienced
                                            as a child.</p>

                                        <p>Your child is precious to us, and we will do everything possible to ensure
                                            that your child's dental visits are a pleasant and rewarding experience.</p>

                                        <p>Preventive dentistry is perhaps the singularly most important role the
                                            pediatric dentist can play in your child's life. Beginning dental visits
                                            early is the key to success, as it helps and assists us in recognizing
                                            and warding off potential problems before they become serious.</p>

                                        <p>Preventive dentistry means a happy and healthy child: a child who can chew
                                            food more easily and gain more nutrients from the foods they eat, a child
                                            who can speak more quickly and clearly, a child with confidence
                                            because they have a healthy smile and appearance. And of importance to you,
                                            as a parent, preventive dentistry means less extensive, and less expensive,
                                            treatment for you child.

                                        <p>Preventive dentistry begins with the first tooth, typically around one year
                                            of age. This is the time you should schedule your child's initial visit with

                                            thoroughly examining your child to detect any potential problem areas, diet
                                            counseling, and if necessary, fluoride applications/recommedations.
                                            This will help ensure your child grows up as part of the ‘cavity free
                                            generation’. Remember, the earlier the dental visit, the better the chance
                                            of preventing dental disease in your child.</p>

                                        <p>The part of the tooth you see is called the crown. The rounded high parts of
                                            the back teeth are cusps. The hard white outer covering of the tooth is the
                                            enamel. Below the gumline, holding the tooth in the jawbone
                                            is the root of the tooth. You can’t see the roots. The inner portions of the
                                            tooth consist of the dentin, a bonelike tissue, and the pulp. The pulp is
                                            like a house for the nerves and blood vessels at the center
                                            of the crown and root.</p>

                                        <p>Teeth have different shapes for different jobs. For example, when you eat,
                                            the upper teeth work together with the lower teeth of the same shape to
                                            bite, chew, and tear food. The names of these teeth are</p>

                                            <li><b>Incisors</b> There are eight incisors located in the front of the
                                                mouth (four on the top and four on the bottom). They have sharp,
                                                chisel-shaped crowns that cut food.</li>

                                            <li><b>Cuspids.</b> The four cuspids are next to each incisor. Cuspids have
                                                a pointed edge to tear food.</li>

                                            <li><b>Premolars.</b> Also called bicuspids, the four pairs of molars are
                                                located next to the cuspids. They crush and tear food.</li>

                                            <li><b>Molars.</b> There are twelve molars, in sets of three, at the back of
                                                the mouth. They have wide surfaces that help to grind food.</li>

                                        <p>Adults have 32 teeth. Depending on their age, children may have fewer because
                                            they lose baby teeth as adult teeth grow. In addition to chewing, teeth help
                                            you to speak clearly. The shape of the arch inside the mouth
                                            helps you talk. Many letters of the alphabet cannot be sounded without the

                                        <p>Your child's first set of teeth, the primary teeth, are extremely important.
                                            Strong, healthy primary teeth help your child chew food easily, learn to
                                            speak clearly, and look good. Just as important, your child's
                                            general health can be affected if diseased and broken primary teeth are not
                                            treated early. Regular dental visits can save time, money and your child's
                                            teeth.</p>

                                        <p><b>At what age should my child first see a dentist?</b></p>

                                        <p>Ideally, it is best to take your child to the dentist between six and twelve
                                            months of age. The earlier you begin, the better chance your dentist has to
                                            prevent problems.By starting dental visits at an early age,
                                            you will help your child build a lifetime of good dental habits.</p>

                                        <p><b>How often should my child see the dentist?</b></p>

                                        <p>While there is no set rule, it is generally recommended that children visit
                                            the dentist every six months. The frequency of dental visits will partly
                                            depend on your child's eating habits, how clean his or her teeth
                                            are kept and whether your child drinks fluoridated water.</p>

                                        <p>We will explain our procedures to your child in easy understandable terms
                                            before we actually do it. Remember, we are pediatric dentists, and children
                                            are our only patients, ‘first class citizens’ in our office.</p>

                                        <p>At this first visit, we will answer any questions you may have and do a
                                            comprehensive examination of your child's mouth. This will include
                                            evaluating the supporting structures and the teeth themselves. Your child's
                                            bite (occlusion) will also be evaluated. Usually, we will clean a child's
                                            teeth at this first visit also. Application of topical fluoride will depend
                                            on the child's age and the need for X-rays (tooth pictures)
                                            will be determined on an individual basis (not routine). Subsequent
                                            appointments may be scheduled for cleaning, fluoride treatments, or other
                                            treatments as needed.</p>

                                        <p><b>Your aim as a parent and ours as a dentist are the same. To keep your

                                        <p>Crying is a normal reaction to almost any kind of anxiety in a young child.
                                            New experiences, strange people and places fit in that category for the very
                                            young. Please do not let your child's occasional tears upset
                                            you as it is very common and we anticipate crying in some small children.
                                            The more relaxed we ( parent and dental staff ) are at that time, the sooner
                                            the child will overcome his/her anxiety. As a parent myself,
                                            I am aware that a crying child is often harder on us parents than the child
                                            itself. Trust me on this one! It will go away with time, in some cases it
                                            takes several visits, and no harm is done.</p>

                                        <p>Your baby can grow up cavity free if you start good dental care early. You've
                                            probably noticed just how important your baby's mouth is to them. Babies use
                                            their mouth for the obvious things, like eating and communicating
                                            their needs, but also for expressing feelings, exploring their world, and
                                            for their own personal security. Here we will take you through some of the
                                            important dental milestones you will go through with your
                                            baby, and teach you some of the things you can do to safeguard your baby's
                                            dental health.</p>

                                        <p>You've probably noticed your baby derives much pleasure from sucking, and
                                            important and satisfying activity which is a normal part of their
                                            development. Babies begin sucking their thumbs and fingers before they
                                            are born. Sucking actually serves an important purpose, it helps strengthen
                                            and develop the oral muscles, which in turn helps position their teeth in
                                            the proper position as they appear. Whether you choose to
                                            let them suck a thumb or a pacifier really doesn't matter. If you choose a
                                            pacifier however, be sure:</p>

                                        <ul>

                                            <li>It is designed for safety! It should be constructed in one piece of a
                                                flexible but firm non-toxic material. The nipple and mouthguard should
                                                not be separate. It should also have an easily held handle or grip.</li>

                                            <li>The mouthguard should contain ventilating holes, and the pacifier should
                                                be large enough to prevent it from being sucked into baby's mouth.</li>

                                            <li><b>NEVER</b> tie the pacifier around baby's neck.</li>

                                            <li>Should always be kept clean. Wash it before giving it to baby, every
                                                time. If it wears out, get a new one.</li>

                                            <li>Never sweeten it by putting honey or sugar on the nipple. This can cause
                                                baby bottle tooth decay, and cause serious damage to your child's teeth.
                                            </li>

                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Most children give up the sucking habit at 4 or 5 years of age. If your child
                                            hasn't, they may need help with their oral habit. See your pediatric dentist
                                            immediately!</p>

                                        <p><b>Teething</b></p>

                                        <p>Around 6 months of age, your baby's first shiny white tooth will usually
                                            appear, typically in the front center of the lower jaw. This eruption of
                                            primary teeth (baby teeth – refer dental chart) is called teething.</p>

                                        <p>Minor discomfort is associated with teething, and some of the symptoms you
                                            will see include irritability, sore or inflamed gums, excessive drooling of
                                            saliva, loss of appetite, a change in eating habits or difficulty
                                            in sleeping. These should not cause alarm and are to be expected. However,
                                            if your baby experiences other problems during the teething process such as
                                            rash, fever or vomiting, something else may be wrong. Consult
                                            with your pediatrician in those cases, and do not make the assumption it is
                                            due to teething.</p>

                                        <p>The best thing to do to aid discomfort is to clean your baby's mouth with a
                                            damp gauze pad two or three times daily, and giving your baby a teething
                                            ring to chew on.</p>

                                        <p><b>Caring for Baby's First Teeth</b></p>

                                        <p>Good dental habits begin early, and by caring for your baby's mouth and teeth
                                            as early as you can, you will help baby develop good dental habits. You can
                                            use our checklist as a quick reference.</p>

                                        <p>You should actually begin cleaning your baby's mouth with the first day of
                                            life. Wipe out the mouth gently and massage the gums pads after each feeding
                                            with before bedtime with a damp gauze pad wrapped around your
                                            finger or a damp washcloth. Hold your baby so that their head rests
                                            comfortably in your lap, this will aid stability and provide better
                                            visibility.</p>

                                        <p>Begin cleaning baby's first teeth as soon as they appear through the gum.
                                            Continue to use a gauze wrapped finger or you may use a very soft bristled
                                            child-sized toothbrush. At this point in their life, it is not
                                            necessary to use toothpaste. Sometime after the first tooth comes in, and
                                            preferably not later than 1 year old, you should schedule your child for
                                            their first dental visit.</p>

                                        <p>As teeth continue to come in, you may also begin gently flossing between the
                                            teeth that touch.</p>

                                        <p>After teeth begin coming in, avoid sending your child to bed with a baby
                                            bottle unless it is water only. This can lead to a serious condition we see
                                            all to often called baby bottle tooth decay.</p>

                                            frequently, is "Baby Bottle Tooth Decay". This single condition probably
                                            causes more pain and suffering in small children than all other
                                            conditions combined, and it is so easily preventable. Could anyone harm a
                                            child as precious as this one? No, of course not! None of us would harm our
                                            children's teeth and cause them severe pain intentionally,
                                            yet thousands of parents are doing this without knowing it. This section of

                                        <p><b>What is baby bottle tooth decay and how does it occur?</b></p>

                                        <p>Baby bottle tooth decay is a dental condition that can destroy the teeth of
                                            an infant or young child. It occurs when a child's teeth are frequently
                                            exposed to sugary liquids for long periods. Among these are milk
                                            (including breast milk),infant formula, fruit juice, soft drinks and other
                                            sweetened liquids.</p>

                                        <p>When a baby is put to bed with a bottle, the liquid drips into the mouth
                                            continuously. It collects around the teeth as long as the bottle is in the
                                            mouth, and is like sending the baby to bed with a mouthful of candy.</p>

                                        <p>Take a look at the above pictures. In the left photo, notice how all teeth
                                            are severely decayed except the lower ones. As a child sleeps with the
                                            bottle, his tongue covers the lower teeth, protecting them. When
                                            we see a mouth like this, as dentists we know the child has been sleeping
                                            with a bottle. Notice also how inflamed and swollen the gums are compared to
                                            a healthy mouth and teeth on the right.</p>

                                        <p><b>Can all the teeth be affected?</b></p>

                                        <p>The teeth most likely to be damaged are the upper front teeth, but other
                                            teeth can be damaged also. Your child's first set of teeth - the 'baby' or
                                            primary teeth - are very important in helping your child chew food
                                            easily, learn to speak clearly, and look attractive. Decay in primary teeth
                                            can affect our child's erupting permanent teeth, cause pain, and can be
                                            associated with general health problems in some children. Therefore,
                                            to avoid future problems, it's important to keep teeth healthy.</p>

                                        <p><b>What causes decay to occur?</b></p>

                                        <p>An invisible sticky film called ‘Plaque’ covers teeth. Bacteria in plaque use
                                            sugar to produce acids. These acids then attack tooth enamel. If sugary
                                            liquid is allowed to remain in the mouth, the bacteria have more
                                            time to produce acids that can attack the teeth. Tooth decay can then occur
                                            after frequent acid attacks.</p>

                                        <p>It's not just what children drink, but <b>how often and for how long</b>
                                            their teeth are exposed to decay-causing acids. That's why frequently
                                            offering your child a bottle containing sugary liquid as a pacifier,
                                            or allowing your child to fall asleep with a bottle during naps or at night,
                                            can do serious harm to the teeth.</p>

                                        <p><b>What can parents do to prevent baby bottle tooth decay?</b></p>

                                        <p>You can prevent this from happening to your child’s teeth by learning how to
                                            protect them.</p>

                                        <ul>

                                            <li>Clean your child’s teeth daily</li>

                                            <li>Never allow your child to fall asleep with a bottle filled with juice,

                                                time as a pacifier)</li>

                                        <p>We feel strongly about prevention of tooth decay. Tooth decay is the most
                                            widespread dental disease among children, but also the most preventable. One
                                            of the methods we employ as a deterrent to tooth decay is a
                                            "sealant". A sealant is a plastic-like material which is painted on the
                                            tooth surface and hardened.</p>

                                        <p>Because the back teeth have depressions and grooves on their chewing
                                            surfaces, which tend to trap food, they are difficult or impossible to clean
                                            and eventually develop decay. Sealants fill in the grooves and prevent
                                            this decay. Usually, sealants are applied on permanent molars right after
                                            eruption.</p>

                                        <p>As you can see from the following diagram, the sealant forms a coating or
                                            barrier to protect the tooth from bacteria and bits of food. By protecting
                                            the depressions and grooves with a coating of sealant, we can
                                            dramatically reduce the risk of decay for children and teens.</p>

                                            use of sealants.</p>

                                        <p><b>How do sealants work?</b></p>

                                        <p>Even if your child brushes and flosses carefully, it is difficult - sometimes
                                            impossible - to clean the tiny grooves and pits on certain teeth. Food and
                                            bacteria build up in these depressions, placing you child
                                            in danger of tooth decay. Sealants "seal out" food and plaque, thus reducing
                                            the risk of decay.</p>

                                        <p><b>Which teeth should be sealed?</b></p>

                                        <p>The teeth most at risk of decay - and therefore most in need of sealants -
                                            are the six-year and twelve year molars. But any tooth with grooves or pits
                                            may benefit from the protection of sealants.</p>

                                            habits that may be occurring with your child, and to suggest any steps

                                            with your child's dental health or development.</p>

                                        <p>When we speak of oral habits, we are typically speaking of any thumb, finger,
                                            or pacifier habits that may be causing damaging effects to the normal growth
                                            and development due to sucking or biting habits of the child.
                                            This type of sucking is completely normal for babies and young children as
                                            it provides a kind of security for them.</p>

                                            between the ages of two to four years. No harm is done to their teeth or
                                            jaws. However, some children continue these habits much longer, and
                                            this is where problems can occur.</p>

                                        <p>Habits can be responsible for a number of problems. <b>Thumb and finger
                                                habits</b> can cause an anterior open bite, facial movement of the upper

                                            for too long a period of time. If so, we will suggest your

                                        <p>Baby teeth usually stay in place until "pushed out" by a permanent tooth that
                                            takes it's place. Unfortunately, some children lose baby teeth too early. A
                                            tooth may be knocked out accidentally or be removed due to
                                            severe disease. When this occurs, a space maintainer may be required to
                                            prevent future dental problems. Space maintainers encourage normal
                                            development of the jaw bones and muscles, and save space for the permanent
                                            teeth and help guide them into position.</p>

                                        <p><b>How can losing a baby tooth too early cause problems for permanent
                                                teeth?</b></p>

                                        <p>Teeth are strange in that regard. Teeth attempt to "fill" any space available
                                            to them. If your child loses a baby tooth to early, the remaining baby teeth
                                            may tilt, drift, or move up or down to fill the gap. When
                                            this happens, they fill the space intended for the permanent tooth, and the
                                            permanent tooth can come in crowded or crooked. And this condition, if left
                                            untreated, may require extensive (and expensive) orthodontic
                                            treatment (braces or even surgery).</p>

                                        <p><b>What are space maintainers?</b></p>

                                        <p>Simply put, they are an appliance made of plastic or metal custom fit to your
                                            child's mouth to maintain the space intended for the permanent tooth when it
                                            decides to come in. They do this by "holding open" the empty
                                            space left by a lost tooth by preventing movement in the remaining teeth
                                            until the permanent tooth takes it's natural position in the child's mouth.
                                            This treatment is much more affordable and much easier on
                                            your child than to move them back later with orthodontic procedures. Think
                                            of space maintainers as insurance against braces.</p>

                                        <p><b>Should children use a different toothbrush than adults?</b></p>

                                        <p>Children should use smaller brushes with shorter brushing planes in
                                            proportion to the size of their mouths. Most children use brushes that are
                                            too big to be easily maneuvered into small spaces in their mouth.</p>

                                        <p><b>Should children use the same toothpaste as adults?</b></p>

                                        <p>All that you need from your toothpaste is the fluoride that helps strengthen
                                            your teeth and protects them from cavities. The time you should spend
                                            brushing and your technique are more important, so go with the flavor
                                            you prefer. Remember only a pea-sized drop of paste on your brush is all
                                            that is necessary.</p>

                                        <p><b>How many times each day should teeth be brushed? And When?</b></p>

                                        <p>The two really important times to brush your teeth are in the morning after
                                            breakfast and at night before you go to bed. Any extra times you brush
                                            during the day is great particularly after eating stick and sugary
                                            foods.</p>

                                        <p><b>Should I clean my baby's teeth?</b></p>

                                        <p>Definitely. Even before the first tooth appears, use a soft, clean cloth to
                                            wipe your baby's gums and cheeks after feeding. As soon as the first tooth
                                            appears, begin using a small, soft bristled tooth brush to clean
                                            the tooth after eating. Don't cover the brush with toothpaste. Young
                                            children tend to swallow most of the toothpaste, and swallowing too much
                                            fluoridated toothpaste can cause permanent spots on their teeth called
                                            dental fluorosis</p>

                                        <p><b>I find brushing my child's teeth awkward. Any suggestions?</b></p>

                                        <p>Try having your child lie down. Put your child on your lap or on the floor,
                                            keeping his/her head steady with your legs. If your child is standing, have
                                            his/her back to you with their head tilted slightly and resting
                                            against your body. Have your child hold a mirror while you brush and floss
                                            their teeth so your child can see what is being done.</p>

                                        <p><b>Is it important to brush before bed?</b></p>

                                        <p>Yes. If you have to miss a brushing, the bedtime one is probably the worst
                                            one to miss. If you don't get rid of the bacteria and sugar that cause
                                            cavities, they have all night to do harm. While you are awake, saliva
                                            helps keep the mouth clean. When you are asleep, there is less saliva
                                            produced to clean the mouth. For this reason it is important to brush before
                                            bedtime.</p.>

                                        Congratulations to Dr. Karthik and Dr. Sandhya of Vibha Dental Clinic, Domlur on
                                        their completion of ten years of service and on the expansion of facilities at
                                        their Clinic.<br /> More than a year ago I located
                                        their Clinic from the Net and approached them for information regarding dental
                                        implant and other treatment choices. Being a senior citizen, and based on my own
                                        earlier experience of dental treatment, I was rather
                                        apprehensive about going for the expensive and 'risky' option of dental implant.
                                        Not only did they allay my apprehensions but provided me with appropriate and
                                        professional treatment in a friendly environment. Apart
                                        from the implant, I have availed myself of other dental services at their Clinic
                                        such as root canal treatment, surgical extractions and crowning. I have pleasure
                                        in placing on record my complete satisfaction with
                                        the treatment provided at this Clinic. Provision of quality care by competent
                                        professionals in an upscale neighbourhood has necessarily to come at a price
                                        which I think their patients acknowledge and appreciate.<br /> I wish this
                                        Clinic and the charming and courteous couple who run them success and prosperity
                                        in the years to come.

                                        Thanks for all your help and it was really great experience so far. Prior to
                                        visit we were so much worried about our Daughter's teeth and also it was always
                                        bothering us. But now it is so much relief and peace of mind, and also our

                                        never felt any problem later. Also she can eat anything without worry or pain.
                                        We can say her SMILE is back.<br /> Additionally, the appointment system,
                                        timing, service and
                                        visits are so comfortable that we never had any waiting or any other kind of
                                        inconvenience. Also the service / visiting charge / replacement of broken or
                                        damaged teeth after root canal etc services are much convenient.<br /> Basically
                                        we are Happy, and do NOT hesitate to give reference to friends / family.

                                        <p>Calculus is dental plaque that has mineralized. Calculus can form when plaque
                                            is not removed from the tooth surfaces. This plaque becomes old and
                                            eventually forms into calculus. Calculus can form above or below
                                            the gumline. The bacteria that sticks to calculus can cause gum disease
                                            (gingivitis) or periodontal disease. Calculus cannot be removed by brushing
                                            and flossing. A dental hygienist checks for calculus formation
                                            when you visit the dental office. It is removed with special instruments
                                            designed to adapt to the tooth surface affected without causing trauma to
                                            the soft gums.</p>

                                                itself (your flow of saliva); diet (frequency and selection of sugary

                                                compound produced by bacteria. Dead and dying bacterial cells release

                                        <p>Today, with modern dentistry, root canal treatment has become a common form
                                            of treatment for diseased (abscessed) teeth.</p>

                                        <p>HERE'S HOW IT'S DONE: In healthy teeth, the interior of the tooth is filled
                                            with tissue (pulp). Once the tooth is injured, cracked, or decayed, it is
                                            necessary to open the tooth and clean out the infected tissue
                                            in the centre. This space is then filled and the opening sealed. During the
                                            procedure the area around the tooth is frozen. Sometimes difficulties may be
                                            encountered during or after root canal treatment. This
                                            may require the use of medication or involve further treatment. A crown or
                                            cap may be necessary to protect the tooth, once the root canal treatment has
                                            been completed.</p>

                                        <p>Teeth that have had root canal treatment can stay as healthy and last as long
                                            as other teeth. In most instances, you won't be able to feel or see a
                                            difference.</p>

                                        <p>A crown or cap is a cover that fits over a properly prepared tooth that has
                                            been damaged by decay or accident, or is badly stained or shaped.</p>

                                        <p>A crown can be made of acrylic, metal, porcelain, porcelain and metal, or
                                            resined metal. All-porcelain crowns look more like your natural teeth, and
                                            therefore are usually used for front teeth; while porcelain with
                                            metal underlay has more strength and is good for crowns in the back of the
                                            mouth. Sometimes all-metal crowns are used for back teeth because of the
                                            metal's strength.</p>

                                        <p>HERE'S HOW IT'S DONE: In order to prepare your tooth for a crown, you require
                                            a local anaesthetic. Then the tooth is filed down so the cap can fit over
                                            it. An impression of your teeth and gums is made and a temporary
                                            cap is fitted over the tooth until the permanent crown is made. On your next
                                            visit, the dentist will remove the temporary cap and cement the crown onto
                                            the tooth. The crown will closely match your natural teeth
                                            and give you back your smile.</p>

                                        <p>Dentures are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There
                                            are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent
                                            the others from changing position, and complete dentures,
                                            which replace every tooth in the mouth. Both types of dentures are removable
                                            and usually made of metal and acrylic resin (say: ah-kri-lick reh-zen), a
                                            plastic-like material that is molded to fit the exact shape
                                            of a person's mouth. Dentures are held in place with the help of a sticky
                                            cream that helps the dentures stick to the surface of a person's gums.</p>

                                            at (especially if someone takes out his dentures in front of you), dentures
                                            are important for older folks who have lost their teeth. They
                                            help a person chew, talk, and even smile! Because they are custom-made by
                                            dentists from molds of a person's mouth (much like a retainer), each set of
                                            dentures is as unique as the person who wears them. No buying
                                            them off the shelf at the denture store!</p>

                                        <p>If you know someone with dentures, don't make fun of the dentures or act
                                            grossed out. After all, you know plenty of kids with braces and retainers,
                                            right? Dentures aren't all that different. For the person wearing
                                            them, they may take some getting used to at first. If you've had braces, you
                                            may remember how it took a while to get used to having a mouth full of
                                            metal. Your mouth may have felt sore, you may have had more
                                            saliva (spit), and it may have hurt to talk for a few days. It's the same
                                            with dentures. Like braces or retainers, they also need special care - they
                                            need to be brushed daily with a special denture brush and
                                            cleanser or toothpaste and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth.
